# My First Node.js App

This is my very first Node.js app, which can be run on your local host.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine with:

```
git clone https://github.com/EzgiTastan/nodejs_first_localhost3000.git
cd nodejs_first_localhost3000
```
2. Run the following command to start the app on your local host:
```
node index.js
```
3. Visit http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to see the app in action. spoiler(!):
